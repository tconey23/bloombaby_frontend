# bLOOMbABY | Group Project
**Overview:**
**bLOOMbABY** leverages Three.js to create a dynamic app that procedurally generates and simulates the lifespans of plants within a virtual garden, offering nostalgic 3D visualization, efficient performance, and an engaging interactive experience. Three.js's capability to render complex plant geometries with advanced graphics effects allows for the generation of unique plants and their environments. This technology enhances user engagement through interactive manipulation and real-time growth simulations. Procedural generation ensures each plant is unique, providing scalability and flexibility to the simulation.

## Wins
A significant achievement in this project was our successful collaboration with the backend team. This collaboration allowed us to synchronize frontend visuals with the underlying data operations, essential for the dynamic functionalities of our application. Through regular meetings, detailed documentation, and the use of collaborative tools, we managed to bridge the gap between different technical disciplines. This allowed for a seamless integration of the 3D rendering done on the frontend with the data processing and storage handled by the backend.

## Challenges
Tackling Three.js for the first time presented many challenges, particularly due to its complex and math-heavy syntax and the introduction of complex components unique to the library. Aditionally, our encounter with shaders presented a steep learning curve. Approaching shaders for the first time meant understanding their role in rendering and manipulating visuals directly through the GPU, a new concept essential for achieving the desired visual effects in our application. Furthermore, familiarizing ourselves with the vast array of new components included in Three.js, such as cameras, lights, and mesh materials, necessitated a comprehensive study and experimentation phase. These components are integral to constructing and managing 3D scenes, as mastering their use was critical to the full capabilities of Three.js in our project.

## Up Next 
As we look to enhance our application further, one exciting feature we plan to incorporate is a breeding mechanic. This addition will allow for the spontaneous combination of genes from two adjacent plants within the virtual garden. Our goal with this mechanic is to simulate a genetic exchange that mirrors natural breeding processes, where offspring exhibit a mix of traits from their parent plants.

## Testing
- `cd` into the repo
- run `npx cypress open` to open the testing window
